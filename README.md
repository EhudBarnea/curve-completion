# CurveCompletion
Curve completion based on the statistics of curves


Running the code:
Change the working directory to 'src', configure parameters by running the first section of 'util.m', and then run any other section.

Externals:
1. Download and extract the files for the export_fig and kde2d libraries as specified in the folders 'src/export_fig' and 'src/kde2d'. For example, (at least) these two files should be present:
src/kde2d/kde2d.m
src/export_fig/export_fig.m
2. For extracting curves, the 'curve fragments dataset' should be placed in the 'data/curve fragments dataset/CFGD_release' folder. For example (at least) this file should be present:
data/curve fragments dataset/CFGD_release/GT_mat_CFGD_format/2018.mat
