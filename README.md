# CurveCompletion
Curve completion based on the statistics of natural curves:
Barnea E. and Ben-Shahar O., Curve Reconstruction via the Global Statistics of Natural Curves, CVPR 2018

Running the code:
Change the working directory to 'src', configure parameters by running the first section of 'util.m', and then run any other section.

Externals:
For extracting curves, the 'curve fragments dataset' should be placed in the 'data/curve fragments dataset/CFGD_release' folder. For example (at least) this file should be present:
data/curve fragments dataset/CFGD_release/GT_mat_CFGD_format/2018.mat
